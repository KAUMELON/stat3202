<p>Experiments in which only a single factor varies while all others are kept constant are called single-factor experiments. In such experiments, the treatments consist solely of the different levels of the single variable factor. All other factors are maintained uniformly in all other experimental units.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>An experiment to find out the best nitrogen level for getting high yield, where 5 different nitrogen levels are tested. Here nitrogen levels are the treatments all other factors like irrigation, light, fertility gradient will be assumed to be homogenous in all experimental units (here plots are the experimental units).</p></li>
<li><p>An experiment to find out the best feed formulation for milk yield in cows from 4 feed formulas. Here feed formula is the only factor which varies with 4 levels. All other factors like breed of cow, age etc will be kept constant.</p></li>

<span class="header-section-number">19.1</span> Completely Randomized Design (CRD)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#crd"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Completely Randomized Design is the basic single factor design. In this
design the treatments are assigned completely at random so that each
experimental unit has the same chance of receiving any one treatment.
CRD is only appropriate for experiments with homogeneous experimental
units, such as laboratory and green house experiments, where
environmental effects are relatively easy to control. For field
experiments, where there is generally large variation among experimental
plots, CRD is rarely used.</p>
<p>CRD provides a layout for conducting experiments, when experimental
units are homogeneous. Only two basic principles of design,
randomization <a href="design-of-experiments.html#rand">15.8.1</a> and replication<a href="design-of-experiments.html#rep">15.8.2</a> are followed in
CRD. Local control<a href="design-of-experiments.html#local">15.8.3</a> is not required as all the experimental
units are homogeneous. Treatments can have unequal replications in CRD</p>

<p>Consider an experiment involving four treatments A, B, C, D in CRD. Each treatment is replicated 5 times. Randomization procedure is as explained below.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Determine the total number of experimental units (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) as the product of the number of treatments (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>) and the number of replications (<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>); that is, <span class="math inline">\(n = r\  \times t\)</span>.

<li><p>Assign a unit number to each experimental units in any convenient manner; for example, consecutively from 1 to n. For our example, the unit numbers 1, ... , 20 are assigned to the 20 experimental units as shown in Figure <a href="single-factor-experiments.html#fig:crdnumbered">19.1</a></p></li>

</h3>
<p>An experimenter is free to choose any number of replications in the experiment. The precision in estimating experimental error variance increases as the number of replications increases. But the design should be such that the number of replications should be optimum, since increasing the replications will increase the experiment cost. So, there
is a rule of thumb that says, error degrees of freedom should be at least 12 to keep type II error in check. One can easily find the number of replications required in a design by using the formula for error degrees of freedom of that design.</p>
<div id="example-10" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Example<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#example-10"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>You have 5 treatments; you are planning to conduct the experiment in CRD. Find the minimum number of replications required.</p>
<p>Formula for error degrees of freedom (<em>edf</em>) in CRD is <span class="math inline">\(n - t\)</span>; where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of experimental units and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the number of treatments. <span class="math inline">\(n = rt\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the number of replications.</p>
<p><em>edf</em> should be <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span> 12</p>
<p><em>edf</em> <span class="math inline">\(= n - t = rt - t = t\left( r - 1 \right) \geq 12\)</span></p>
<p>Since t = 5, <em>edf</em> <span class="math inline">\(= 5\left( r - 1 \right) \geq 12\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(= r \geq 3.4\)</span>, Since <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> cannot be a fraction <span class="math inline">\(r =\)</span> 4</p>
<p>The number of replications required in 4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why minimum error degrees of freedom required for a design is 12</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The error degrees of freedom have a major role in deciding the critical value of F. You can see from the table of F in section <a href="ftable.html#ftable">20</a> as the error degrees of freedom or the degrees of freedom in the denominator decreases F tends to have larger values, this inflates type II error, <em>i</em>.<em>e</em>. we will be able to reject the null hypothesis only if there is a considerable difference between the treatments (higher
Treatment Sum of Square). But towards 12 degrees of freedom in the denominator the F values stabilize for further increase in degrees of freedom.</p>

<p>In the above table we can see that difference between mean of V2 and V1
is 4 which is greater than C.D. value. So V2 and V1 are significantly
different; different letters are assigned to each of them. Instead of
letters one can also use symbols as shown below. Those treatments with
same letters/symbols are not significantly different.</p>

</h2>
<p>In field experiments, the plots on which treatments are applied may not be uniform and there may be difference in plot-to-plot fertility. In such cases CRD cannot be
recommended. If there is only one source constitutes the difference between the plots then we can recommend randomized block design.</p>
<p>The randomized complete block (RCB) design is one of the most widely used experimental designs in agricultural research. The design is especially suited for field experiments where the number of treatments is not large and the experimental area has a predictable fertility gradient.</p>
<p>When the experimental material is heterogeneous, the experimental material is grouped into homogeneous sub-groups called <strong>blocks</strong>. As each block consists of the entire set of treatments a block is equivalent to a replication. For example, in a field with known fertility gradient in one direction, plots perpendicular to this gradient will be considered as a block. In RCBD (Randomized Complete
Block Design) blocks are of equal size and contains all the treatments. Since the block contains all the treatments, the term ‘complete block design’ is used. See figure @ref(fig: field) and @ref(fig: field2) to see how blocks are formed in a field.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In RCBD number of replications, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> = number of blocks<br>
Number of plots within a block = number of treatments, <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span></p>

<span class="header-section-number">19.2.1</span> Blocking technique<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#blocking-technique"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Blocking or local control, one of the basic principles of design is effectively implemented in RCBD. The primary purpose of blocking is to reduce experimental error by eliminating the contribution of known sources of variation among experimental units. This is achieved by grouping homogeneous units together, so that variability with in blocks is minimized, between blocks is maximized.</p>
<p>Two important factors to be considered for blocking</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The selection of the source of variability to be used as the basis for blocking, in field experiments usually fertility gradient or productivity gradient is used as the identified source of variability.</p></li>
<li><p>Proper selection of the block shape and orientation. For example, When the gradient is unidirectional use long and narrow blocks. Use square blocks for strong fertility gradient in both directions. An experimenter should use his common sense to identify the shape and orientation of the block after examining the field conditions, suc that plots in a block are homogeneous.</p></li>

<p>STEP 2. Subdivide each block into <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> experimental plots, where <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the number of treatments.

In our example each of the 5 blocks are divided into 4 plots. Plots are numbered 1 to 4 in each block. Now for each block, paper lots of 1 to 4 is prepared.

<p>In this design, variations in the field in two different directions ( or variations
due to two different factors) are controlled simultaneously from affecting the
treatment comparisons. A layout in RBD controls only one source of external
variation affecting the treatment comparisons by the construction of homogeneous
blocks. Sometimes when blocks were laid out in a field the environmental conditions
within each block need not be the same. For example, soil variability in a North South
direction and an environmental gradient in an East West Direction then the conditions
within each block will vary. In such situations the variability can be controlled by a
Latin Square design (LSD). The blocks in a LSD are called rows and columns; they
represent two external factors. The entire experimental area can be divided into small
plots arranged in the form of a square. The number of plots in each row and each
column are equal, both equal to the number of treatments to be compared.</p>

<p>The data collected from experiments in LSD are classified according to the

blockings (Rows and columns) and treatments will make up the three factors.
The linear model for analysis as :
<span class="math display">\[Y_{\text{ij}} = \mu + \tau_{i} + R_{j}+ C_{k}+e_{\text{ijk}}\]</span>
where i,j, k = 1,2,3,… <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span></p>

of treatments like <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> = 2 , 3 and 4 this value is 0 , 2 and 6. ( ie. very small- hence we cannot carryout the experiment as such for these values of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>).</p>
<p>Similarly when <span class="math inline">\(v&gt;10\)</span> the total number of plots required is <span class="math inline">\(v^2\)</span> &gt; 100. So there
will be difficulty in getting large number of homogeneous plots. So LSD is
commonly used for 5 to 10 treatments only.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">19.4</span> MISSING PLOT ANALYSIS<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#missing-plot-analysis"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In agricultural field experiments the experimenter is often encountered with
the situation that the observations of a particular treatment/ plot may be lost or may be affected by some external factors so that it would not be possible to analyse these observations by including it with the normal values. The observation on a treatment may get lost by various reasons like, attack of cattle or birds, manure may be dumped on the side, disease infestation and so on. The data recorded from plots so affected will be omitted and then the analysis is carried out – called as missing plot analysis.</p>
<p>The Analysis of such data may be done by different methods. (i) the most
commonly used method currently adopted is known as ‘method of analysis of non
orthogonal data’ which is highly computer based (ii) Method of substitution by Yates based on minimization of the error sum of squares and (iii) Analysis of the data with missing values by the technique of Analysis of Covariance by Bartlett’s.</p>
<p><strong>Covariance Method by Bartlett’s</strong><br>
Assume an imaginary covariate X taking values zero for every plot except the
missing plot for which it will take the value 1 (or –1) . Now the value of the main variate Y = 0 for the missing plot, and the actual values for the remaining plots. The data will be analysed as per the ANCOVA technique of the respective design used.<br>
In missing plot analysis the degrees of freedom for error and total will be
based on the existing number of observations only. By this method also the degrees of freedom of adjusted error sum of squares will be less by one ( when there is one missing value).</p>
<p><strong>Method of Substitution</strong><br><span class="math inline">\((i)\)</span> In this method we will calculate with the aid of a formula an estimate of the missing value. The formula will vary from design to design and actually it will not supply the exact missing value. But the procedure permits the researcher to complete the analysis without resorting to more complex procedures.<br><span class="math inline">\((ii)\)</span> Insert the estimated value in the missing position and workout the estimates of treatment means and mean error sum of squares.<br><span class="math inline">\((iii)\)</span> Some additional adjustments to treatment sum of squares are needed. In pair comparison also some changes are made.<br><span class="math inline">\((iv)\)</span> An iterative procedure is adopted when more than one observation is missing.</p>

G = Grand total of all existing observations.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\((ii)\)</span> This estimate of the missing value is placed in its position and the analysis is carried out based on the procedure of RBD. Subtract one degree of freedom from the total and error degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>This method provides a proper estimate of the error variance per plot but there
is an inflation in treatment sum of squares; ( the treatment sum of squares is positively biased). If the treatments turn out to be not significant we can ignore the bias and the results are accepted. But if the treatments turns out to be just significant it may be due to this bias. In that case an actual treatment sum of squares is obtained by a suitable formula.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\((iii)\)</span> Estimate of Bias in the case of RBD
<span class="math display">\[Bias=\frac{(B+vT-G)^2}{v(v-1)(r-1)^2}\]</span>

treatment mean square against the Mean Square for error: and make the conclusion about the significance of treatments.<br><span class="math inline">\((iv)\)</span> Pair comparison<br><span class="math inline">\((a)\)</span> For comparing two treatment means in which one of them contain a missing observation
